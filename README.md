# Tara's Personal Website
Currently undergoing an overhaul.

## Purpose
For communicating what I've been learning or noticing in computer
science-related groups.

## Current Status
I'm tearing down my blog/website for now to think more about what I want it to
become; it was mainly a project in using GitHub Pages, but I want it to help
me communicate with others: friends, family, strangers learning things, and my
future self.

For now, all I know is that I want to do more blog posts and that I want to
have a design based on my Hobonichi planner. I'll add more issues to the repo
as I brainstorm more.
