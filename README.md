# Tara's Personal Website

## Purpose
For communicating what I've been learning or noticing in computer
science-related groups (with friends, family, strangers learning things, and my
future self).

## Current Status
Later on, I want to have a design based on my Hobonichi planner. I'll add more
issues to the repo as I brainstorm more.

## Building your own blog
If you'd also like to create a blog like this, I'd recommend using
[Github Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).
