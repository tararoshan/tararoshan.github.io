Not last week but the week before that I participated in n00bzCTF! I solved 5
problems and had lots of fun working with teammates from Japan. When I woke up
to check the problems to solve, they'd already done so many! Here are a few that
I solved and a couple that I attempted.

# RSA
**Crypto**

> c = 130377...

Where *n* and *c* were about [100-200 digits long](https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF2024-Official-Writeups/blob/main/Crypto/RSA/attachments/encryption.txt). I saw a problem
like this when I was making my RSA presentation for the Directed Reading Program
at university. So I went and found the [writeup](https://github.com/utisss/ctf/tree/ab106a50149827d27e55f81d7691756bc2ce4bb5/2021/ctf-11-05-2021/crypto-textbook-rsa#textbook-rsa),
installed the necessary packages, and we were cracking!

The shell commands used for installing the packages:
```bash
python3 -m venv n00bz-ctf
source n00bz-ctf/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install gmpy
```

The script run to find the flag:
```python
import gmpy
mToE = c
mToE = gmpy.mpz(int(mToE))
m = int(mToE.root(e)[0])
print(bytes.fromhex(hex(m)[2:]))
```

This is explained in point three in [this answer](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/20087) on Cryptography StackExchange
where we do root extraction on *c = m^e*.

# Vinegar 2
**Crypto**

> Never limit yourself to only alphabets!

Given [chall.py](https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF2024-Official-Writeups/blob/main/Crypto/Vinegar2/attachments/chall.py) and [enc.txt](https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF2024-Official-Writeups/blob/main/Crypto/Vinegar2/attachments/enc.txt).
I started by reading through chall.py and adding notes.

# Numbers 2
**Crypto**

The full challenge statement is [here](https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF2024-Official-Writeups/blob/main/Programming/Numbers-2/README.md).

# Subtraction
**Misc**

> My little brother is learning math, can you show him how to do some subtraction problems?

Given [server.py](https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF2024-Official-Writeups/blob/main/Misc/Subtraction/attachments/server.py).

The official writeup suggests using the method that I started out with, but 

And now for the problems I attempted but didn't finish:

# WaaS
**Misc**

# Random
**Crypto**

# Focus on yourSELF
**Web**
