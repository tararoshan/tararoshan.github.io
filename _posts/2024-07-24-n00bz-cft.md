Not last week but the week before that I participated in n00bzCTF! I solved 5
problems and had lots of fun working with teammates from Japan. When I woke up
to check the problems to solve, they'd already done so many! Here are a few that
I solved and a couple that I attempted.

# RSA
**Crypto**

> The cryptography category is incomplete without RSA. So here is a simple RSA challenge. Have fun! <br>
> e = 3 <br>
> n = 135112... <br>
> c = 130377...

Where *n* and *c* were about 100-200 digits long.[^1]

# Vinegar 2
**Crypto**

> Never limit yourself to only alphabets!

Given chall.py[^2] and enc.txt[^3]. I started by reading through chall.py and
adding notes.

# Numbers 2
**Crypto**

The full challenge statement is [here](https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF2024-Official-Writeups/blob/main/Programming/Numbers-2/README.md).

# Subtraction
**Misc**

> My little brother is learning math, can you show him how to do some subtraction problems?

Given server.py[^4].

The official writeup suggests using the method that I started out with, but 

And now for the problems I attempted but didn't finish:

# WaaS
**Misc**

# Random
**Crypto**

# Focus on yourSELF
**Web**
