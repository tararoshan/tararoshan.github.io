If you rode the CapMetro trains today, I'm so sorry for you. We were packed in
like sardines -- people couldn't even get on at some stops. Hopefully CapMetro
plans ahead for the next conference in downtown Austin!

All that to say, today I attended the 2024 [Texas Conference for Women](https://www.txconferenceforwomen.org/). It was a
wonderful experience (especially considering my employer paid for the ticket).
Here are a couple of highlights from the keynotes and breakout sessions.

## That's a Good Question | Navigating New Work Environments
**Breakout Session**

The session started bright and early at 8:45am, while everyone was still waking
up and a bit too quiet to ask questions. So it was a bit of a slow session. One
of the speakers, [Debbie McClure](https://www.txconferenceforwomen.org/speakers/debbie-mcclure/), mentioned the importance of both a personal and
professional "board of directors." While I prefer to call it a "steering
committee" or "council," the point still stands. She also mentioned the
importance of having *multiple* sponsors anytime you want to enact change in
your career.

[Delores Rochester's](https://www.txconferenceforwomen.org/speakers/delores-rochester/) advice of "walking meetings," having 1/1s outside, was
interesting. On the one hand, I like to walk. On the other, it's very difficult
to take notes and remember what the takeaways are when you're walking. For me,
1/1s are not catching up with a friend. They're the exchange of information. My
boss is busy, I can't just run around in circles.

Lastly, there's been some ongoing frustration in my personal steering committee
which prompted me to ask the speakers for good advice on conflict resolution.
[Michele Van De Hey](https://www.txconferenceforwomen.org/speakers/michele-van-de-hey/) gave some good, well-known advice: be open to listen, and
make the other person feel heard. This goes for *both* (or all) sides of the
conversation.

## Essential Boundaries: The Key to Real Self-Care & Burnout Prevention
**Breakout Session**

I *really* enjoyed this session with [Dr. Pooja Lakshmin](https://www.txconferenceforwomen.org/speakers/dr-pooja-lakshmin/). Much of what I've
written here is either direct quotes or conservative paraphrases of Dr.
Lakshmin's talk on bounaries. Though I haven't read it yet, I'd also recommend
checking out her book [Real Self-Care](https://www.poojalakshmin.com/realselfcare) if you find her views to be useful.

Making abrupt decisions because of how you feel can cause "the same scene, just
different context." That is, you could end up feeling the same way but in a new
environment. Instead, it's much better to set boundaries.

Saying "no" at work incurs a cost, and it's a privilege to be able to
uncompromisingly reject a request. Say there are layoffs and your boss wants
you to take on a new project -- maybe your promotion or job are on the table.

So instead, the boundary isn't the "no," it's the pause. This is part of why I
keep my phone on do-not-disturb for all but my family and close friends; leave
a voicemail and I'll pause and listen before deciding if I should call back.

At work, this pause is about preventing yourself from making rash decisions. It
looks like asking, "What do I need to do, operationally, to be able to say 'no'
easier in six months?" So each time you want to reject a request but fear it
would incur too great a cost, make a note of this and reflect on the above
question.

Boundaries, at their core, need to be set to protect your sense of humanity. In
pausing, we are able to think more about ourself. We're able to pause and think
more about others. So it's important to consider how the people above you are.
Are they happy? What's their mental health like? Would *I* like to rise in the
ranks and be like them? Be just as un/happy? Ultimately, even when people give
you advice, they're thinking about what worked for them in the past, even if
they have your best interests in mind. So you've got to sus out your desires
and plan of action yourself.

Boundaries are the net, not the brick wall, that we use in interpersonal
relationships. They're about taking the time to pause.

Now to the talk's takeaways.

First, say yes when people genuinely offer help. These offers are often bids for
human connection (see the Gottman Method below).

Second, implement the pause. When you find yourself wanting to say "no," look
deeper to discover if it's because the request is a risk/challenge, could cause
an interpersonal issue, or poses cross-engagement conflicts (that is, you're
strapped for time).

Finally, a few resources she mentioned were
["The Happiness Project" by Gretchen Rubin](https://gretchenrubin.com/books/the-happiness-project/)
(which she read on her honeymoon) and [The Gottman Method](https://www.gottman.com/about/the-gottman-method/).

# Keynotes
Keeping it short and sweet, my favorite keynote was from [Isabel Allende](https://www.txconferenceforwomen.org/speakers/isabel-allende/). Can you
imagine having such an icon in the same room as you? Utter shock. Anyways, she
was hilariously witty. What stood out to me was her habits. She always begins
writing a new book on January 8th, and she corresponded with her mother daily in
the form of physical letters. These letters helped her write again after her
daughter died. They're also helping her to write her memoir. Those letters
reminded me of Jawaharlal Nehru's [*Glimpses of World History*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glimpses_of_World_History),
Nehru's summary of world history based on letters he penned to his daughter
while in prison.

I loved [Tabitha Brown's](https://www.txconferenceforwomen.org/speakers/tabitha-brown/) ending quote: "Have the most amazing day, but even if
you can't have a good one, don't go messing up no one else's." Something to live
by.
