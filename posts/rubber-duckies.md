title: 'Rubber Duckies: A Creative Essay'

*For my Farsi/Persian class this semester, we had to write a creative essay. My Farsi isn't that*
*great (yet), so I wrote my thoughts in English and translated them. The topic of the essay*
*was 'migration to or from Iran.' Enjoy!*

I always hate the feeling of an unfinished story. It always leaves me with a sense of nervousness and confusion. My questions are left unanswered, like a child left without their parents. Hopefully this story won’t feel that way.

We sold our rugs and filled our suitcases in the middle of the summer heat, when the air was so hot that the sand turned to water under the sun. I remember watching the water trickle down from the eyes of my uncles and cousins. I couldn’t help but think, “Stop wasting your tears in the middle of this drought.” Iran had been my home for 12 years, but I didn’t cry as we left. They didn’t really care about us, anyways. Not about me, at least. Maybe they would miss my brother and dad. I was nothing more than a doll to them.

The airplane felt exciting and then scary. As we started to rise, my ears ears began to hurt. It was as if the souls of my ancestors were screaming at me. “We’ve been here for generations! Not even dogs leave behind their family like this!” But this wasn’t where I belonged. Maybe I would never belong anywhere, but I’d rather leave with my mom than rot in that soul-sucking desert forever.

The first two weeks were so painful. I’d practiced English for months before we’d left, so I thought I’d be able to understand what people were saying, but they just sounded like cats. Cats thats that drank too much milk and didn’t like fish as much I did. I was so scared by the fourth day that I locked myself up in my room and didn’t come out for the whole day. I just cried and cried until I saw the afternoon shadows of the trees fall on my window. My parents didn’t notice, though, because just like at home, they left for work at dawn and returned at dusk. The library was more of my home than the place where I slept.

But by the second week I was ready to try again. It was fall and I couldn’t hear the sounds of the kids playing in the park anymore. My mother gave me a dark blue cloth bag and filled it with notebooks and books and sturdy yellow wooden pencils.

My school started on a Tuesday, right in the middle of the week. Or maybe that’s the day before the middle of the week, depending on how you look at it. My teacher had red hair and wore a bright green shirt, like an upside-down strawberry. By this time, I was able to speak the language of the cats a bit better, so when she said,

“Class, this is Leia. Leia, would you like to introduce yourself? Why don’t you say a bit about yourself,”

I said, “Hello, my name is Layla. I am 12 years old. Nice to meet you. Have a good day.”

The class must’ve thought I was beautiful, since a few of them started saying, “Princess Leia, Princess Leia, where’s your brother Luke?”

After that, the teacher’s face turned the same shade as her hair and she quickly told me to sit in the third row of the class, next to a boy with brown hair and dark eyes.

“Hello,” I said.

“Hi,” he replied. He looked at my braids. “You really like Star Wars, huh?”

I was confused. “I like stars, but I do not like wars…” I knew people in America had guns, but I didn’t think it was this extreme.

His eyebrows came together like caterpillars. “It’s a TV show. I guess you’ve never watched it. You really should, though! It has a lot of cool stuff in it. Hm… The books should be in the library, if you like reading more. Your name sounds like one of the characters’, so I thought you were a fan. Oh right, my name’s Andrew.”

The boy talked so much that I thought he was creepy. Creepy people talk too much. Probably because they’re lonely — since everyone know’s that they’re creepy, so they stay away — and so anytime they can find a warm body, they’ll spill out everything they’ve kept inside. I think lonely people tend to be that way. They keep everything inside until they can’t anymore, and then everything just spills out because everyone avoids them so they have no one to tell their stories to, so as soon as they find anyone they talk and talk for all the times that they couldn’t and so—

“Uh… I guess you don’t like to talk about TV shows.” The boy’s voice shook me from my thoughts. I blinked. “No, I just don’t like to talk to you,” I thought.

The boy’s smile faltered. He seemed nervous, probably because of my silence. He shifted in his seat and turned back to the front of the class. He didn’t talk to me again for the rest of the morning.

I didn’t know it then, but Andrew was a very stubborn child. Every morning, he’d greet me with a bright smile and I’d watch his eyes turn into sideways crescent moons. Every afternoon, he’d become quiet and reserved after talking to me.

But slowly, my icy demeanor melted. We began to read books together and pretend like we were the characters outselves. We taught each other words in Farsi and Vietnamese. He learned that my name was “Layla,” not “Leia.” We became friends.

I remember telling Andrew one day about how sad I was that America never celebrates Norooz like Iran does. “Well, at least we have April Fool’s Day,” he said. But playing pranks on people isn’t quite the same as sharing food and laughing together. Either way, we decided to celebrate April Fool’s Day that year.

There was a beautiful old fountain and pond in the middle of our city park that was always filled with water. That was what inspired our celebration. We went across the town, buying yellow rubber duckies until we’d collected 1000 of them. We must’ve looked insane as we walked through the park, rubber duckies piled so high in our arms that we became lemons with legs.

When we reached the clearning with the fountain, we were filled with a sense of excitement. It was a weekend morning, so the park was empty, save for the birds that filled the air with their songs. I looked at Andrew and he looked back with a toothy grin. We laughed and took off running towards the fountain, our bags of rubber duckies bouncing in the wind behind us. 

We empied the rubber duckies on the highest ledge of the fountain that we could reach and stood back to admire our handiwork. The ducks tumbled over each other, swimming down the water of the fountain into the pond below. Like humans, clamoring for a place in the world to call their own. The reflection of the sky in the pond almost made it seem like they were flying. I wondered if their flight was as painful as mine. Hopefully their ears didn’t hurt.

Andrew and I stared at the ducks and the sky for a while. We knew that we’d have to put the ducks back in our bags and go back home. Maybe we could come back again next year. But for now, we’d just stay by the pond, keeping the ducks company as they kept swimming towards their new homes.
